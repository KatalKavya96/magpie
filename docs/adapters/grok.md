# Grok Build

**Capability:** platform:harness

Grok Build is supported in this PR for the deterministic Magpie action guard.
This does not add Grok spec-loop, headless-runner, or dedicated sandbox-profile support.

## Harness contract

| Surface | Grok contract | Magpie integration |
|---|---|---|
| Hook event | `PreToolUse` | `agent-guard` |
| Shell matcher | `Bash` | `.grok/hooks/magpie-agent-guard.json` or plugin hook |
| Captured shell tool | `run_terminal_command` | reads `toolInput.command` |
| Workspace path | `GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT` | source/snapshot project hook |
| Plugin path | `GROK_PLUGIN_ROOT` | marketplace/plugin hook |
| Deny | JSON decision with reason | shared `dispatch()` result |
| Allow | exit 0 | shared `dispatch()` result |

## Verified runtime

The `PreToolUse` payload contract was captured against:

`grok 1.0.46 (2765805b9442)`

Marketplace/plugin loading and failure semantics were additionally verified
against:

`grok 1.0.50` (`c58f321264ba`)

A real `PreToolUse` payload captured on 2026-10-08 is retained in
`tools/agent-guard/tests/test_grok.py`.
The capture was triggered by asking Grok to run `pwd`.
The captured event reported `toolName: "run_terminal_command"` and placed the
shell command in `toolInput.command`.

## Installation

### Marketplace plugin

Grok reads Claude-compatible marketplaces, plugins, and hooks without extra compatibility setup.
The `magpie-agent-guard` plugin registers its hook through `hooks/hooks.json`.
Its command resolves the bundled guard through
`${GROK_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}`.
Grok supplies `GROK_HOOK_EVENT`, and the no-argument dispatcher detects that
variable and selects `grok_main()`.

The guard runtime is materialized as real files inside the plugin rather than
through an out-of-root symlink, because Grok's local plugin installation does
not preserve that symlink target.

### Framework checkout

The repository hook is:

`.grok/hooks/magpie-agent-guard.json`

It resolves the guard through `GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT` and invokes `--grok`.

### Pinned snapshot

A snapshot adopter may install the same single Magpie-owned project hook.
Its executable path points through
`$GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT/.apache-magpie/tools/agent-guard/`.

Magpie owns only that exact hook file.
It does not own `.grok/hooks/`, `.grok/config.toml`, unrelated hooks, or project trust.

## Trust and security boundary

Project `.grok/hooks/` entries require an explicit Grok trust decision.
Magpie must never grant or reset that trust on the operator's behalf.

The action guard is separate from Grok permissions and from the operating-system sandbox.
It inspects shell commands before execution and rejects commands that violate a
hard Magpie framework rule.
It does not turn native file tools, MCP tools, or the rest of the process into a sandbox.

## Guard behavior

For a relevant `run_terminal_command` event, the adapter passes the command and
optional string `cwd` to the harness-neutral `dispatch()` core.

A denial emits a Grok deny decision containing the shared guard reason and exits
with the guard deny code.
An allowed shell command exits 0 without emitting a decision.

Malformed input, unrelated tools, or an invalid command field handled by the
adapter are ignored and fail open by returning exit 0.

Hook-process failure has different semantics. On Grok 1.0.50, a hook process
that exits 2 blocks the tool call even without deny JSON. A missing Python hook
target likewise produced exit 2 and blocked the shell call. Installation
verification should still exercise a known allow and a known denial rather than
treating configuration presence as sufficient.

## Verify

Use:

`grok inspect --json`

Confirm that the intended Magpie action-guard hook is active and that the
selected installation method has not introduced a duplicate project hook.

For a source or snapshot project hook, verify that its command resolves to an
existing `agent_guard/__init__.py`.
For a marketplace installation, verify that the installed
`magpie-agent-guard` plugin supplies the hook and that no duplicate project hook
was added merely to reach the executable.

Then perform harmless live probes:
one command that Magpie permits and one known guard denial.
A static configuration check does not replace the live denial probe.

## Update and uninstall

Marketplace installations follow the plugin manager lifecycle.
Updating the plugin updates its bundled guard implementation.

Source and snapshot installs compare only
`.grok/hooks/magpie-agent-guard.json` with Magpie's expected shape.
A stock stale copy may be refreshed.
A hand-edited copy must be shown for review before replacement or removal.

Repository uninstall removes only the Magpie-owned project hook.
It does not uninstall a user's marketplace plugin and does not change Grok trust.

## Known limitations

This integration is action-guard only.
It does not add a Grok-specific spec-loop runner or headless execution profile.

Malformed or unrelated input handled inside the adapter is deliberately
fail-open. Hook-process exit 2 is fail-closed on the Grok 1.0.50 runtime tested:
both a bare `exit 2` hook and a missing Python hook target blocked the shell
tool call.

Verification must still include a real denial probe so configuration,
packaging, and runtime behavior are checked together.

The captured payload contract comes from Grok Build 1.0.46.
Marketplace loading, bundled-runtime execution, policy denial, and exit-2
failure behavior were verified on Grok Build 1.0.50.
Future Grok hook-schema changes require a fresh runtime capture before changing
the adapter contract.

## Developer checks

`uv run --directory tools/agent-guard --group dev pytest`

`uv run --directory tools/agent-guard --group dev python -m ruff check src tests`
